            James Francis Gunn Jr. was born on August 5, 1966 in St. Louis, Missouri, to parents James F.
            Gunn, an attorney, and Leota "Lee" (Hynek).He was raised Catholic in the St. Louis suburb of
            Manchester, Missouri.He has five siblings — actor Sean, actor and political writer Matt,
            screenwriter Brian, Patrick, and Beth.Gunn is of Irish descent, his father coming from an
            Irish immigrant family. Gunn has stated that his family's surname was originally the Irish name
            MacGilgunn and that it means "sons to the servants of the god of the dead"; it actually means "son of the
            brown youth." He also has Jewish roots.
        </h5>
        <h5>
            Growing up, Gunn was influenced by low-budget films such as Night of the Living Dead and Friday the 13th. He
            read magazines like Fangoria and attended genre movie screenings, including the original Dawn of the Dead at
            the Tivoli Theatre in St. Louis. At the age of 12, he began making 8 mm zombie films with his brothers in
            the woods near their home.
        </h5>
        <h5>
            Gunn and his brothers all attended the Jesuit St. Louis University High School, where he graduated in
            1984. He went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts from Saint Louis University. While at Saint Louis
            University, Gunn created political cartoons for the school's student weekly, The University News. Gunn
            said that, at an unspecified time in his college education, "I went to two years undergraduate film school
            at Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles. But I was pretty screwed up at the time, and had to leave. Years later I
            went to graduate school at the Columbia University School of Fine Arts but I studied prose writing, not film
            writing." He earned a Master of Fine Arts from Columbia University in 1995.
